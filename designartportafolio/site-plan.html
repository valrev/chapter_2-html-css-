      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p> The main purpose of the site is to showcase conceptual art regarding character design for audiovisual media done by me, so my abilities and process behind creation can be demonstrated for a more professional environment in which this can apply such as animation, videogames, comics or even graphic novels.  After all, how could one tell a story without characters? Or even, characters that don’t fit the setting of the story at all? </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Can range from students taking references, people interested in searching a character designer for an indie project to even professional teams hiring for this type of job.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->
      <!-- Little note here, I used my personal art watermark as a placeholder logo. sorry!!!-->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        As this site is used as a “professional portfolio” of sorts, what is expected is that this is used in a way in which the visitor in question can notice the quality of my works which I have strived to achieve a good level of quality over the years and to which I hope will help me to be part of a project of any kind in some future. Similarly, it can be used as reference by any person, whether they wanted to take them as a reference for to their own creations or want to pay tribute to mine.

      <h3>Designs</h3>
      <p>
        The Designs area brings with it all the content that can be taken as part of the process involved in creating and defining the design of a character, object or place so that it is balanced and visually attractive. Specifically on this page you will see illustrations with trial and error ranging from things as simple as a shape and color.

      <h3>Conceptual Art</h3>
      <p>
        Concept Art refers to all that art created with the purpose of visually defining the initial look of any visual aspect that the medium requires. This is an early stage used to begin to clarify the ideas that are needed to begin polishing through the design stage. In the case of this page, images of early stages of places and environments that were devised from ambiguous concepts and that became clearer over time are shown.
